This code is inspired by GraphDTA-master, and develope basing it, thanks for their contribution.
Firstly, The drug is expressed as molecular graph and ECFP, GCN module and fully connected(FC) layer are used for learning respectively.
Secondly, protein sequence and k-mer feature of protein are input into CNN module and FC layer respectively to learn potential protein features.
Finally, the features learned from the four channels are concatenated and the FC layer is used for prediction.


1. data_process.py: this file is to preprocess the dataset , preparing for training the model
2. training.py : training the 9 models using kiba and davis datasets
3. prediction.py: predicting the test data using pretrained model
4. utils.py: store some needed classes and functions.
5. configuration environment: configurating the environment is a bit complicated, refer to the attached document for details
